# Phising-Email-Simulation-Design


My submission for the Mastercard Cybersecurity Program


The Mastercard Security Awareness team has been asked to think about potential vulnerabilities and how to improve security internally. It has been decided that the first step will be to run a phishing simulation email.

You are an analyst in the team and have been assigned the task to create the upcoming phishing email template for the simulation. Try to make it contextual and believable. The results will help us educate employees on how to identify this type of threat, and therefore prevent a bad actor from successfully launching a phishing campaign on the company.

A few months back - we detected a phishing email that was being used by an external bad actor on some of our employees - thankfully, it failed due to being an obvious fake. However, we know that phishing emails are now getting very sophisticated and a range of tactics are used. Youâ€™ve been asked to use this email as a starting point and improve on it to increase the likelihood of an employee clicking on the link.
